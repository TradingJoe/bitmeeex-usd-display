# BitMEEEX USD Display

Get some sanity into your gambling. Shows all prices in Dollars instead of Bitcoin (**XBT Symbol**). There is no relationship with the [BitMEX*](https://www.bitmex.com/register/KWlPEa). But the functionality was developed and tested only for this exchange.

**This is not an official extension!**

Inspired from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/btc-zz/6b8315f93969ee7caf6c3d66e70ec721).
But this extension has a completely different logic and a much more resilient functionality.
**It will just work.**
